### Salut! 👋

I'm Maxime, a french Front-End developer mostly interested in making maps. 🗺️  I like other stuff too of course but most of my projects will be about that.

I work mostly with JS, React, MapLibre and MUI but sometimes I use TS, Vue, Leaflet and even Tailwind. 🛠

Don't hesitate to go around, I _currently_ (👀) don't have a **public** project I actively maintain so everything is provided "as is". 🚧
