### Salut! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maxime, a french Front-End developer mostly interested in making devs lives easier with things like design systems, component libraries and tools in general. :wrench: Just a bit of my work is here on (public) GitHub, but don't mind taking a look (even if quite a lot is old, I'm not ashamed of it :sweat_smile:)

#### My work is also there :eyes: :

- :brain: [dev.to](https://dev.to/maxbvrn) for technical posts nobody asked for
- :art: [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Bo-Duke) for CSS attempts
- :building_construction: [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/u/Bo-Duke) for bigger projects
- :trumpet: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxbvrn/) if you're not into code
- :warning: [My website](https://bouveronmaxi.me) for other stuff, I'm really not maintaining it (it may even not be reachable...) while I work on a new one but I *really* like the domain
